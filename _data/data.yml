      Dear Mr. Hoffmann,

      I am applying for the C# Software Developer position referred by Tony Le.

      and collaborate with all stakeholders & to deliver customer excellence with the solutions created.

      efficiently and in a timely manner.

      I am amazed with Exro's commitment of building a cleaner and more sustainable electrified world with the development of 
      new technologies for electric vehicles and the innovative energy storage systems using retired EV batteries.

      Dear Annie Tran,

      I am applying for Salesforce Administrator position posted on LinkedIn.

      Working mainly in the I.T. field +15 years provided me to develop different projects with various technologies.

      It broadened my ability to become a proficient problem solver, to work proactively on a team, to communicate and collaborate with all stakeholders & to deliver customer excellence with the solutions created according to their business requirements.

      At Salesforce.com (SFDC), I learned, configured & used most of the various features out-of-the-box that SFDC platform offers. I developed customized solutions for the client’s needs using tools such as Flow Builder, Apex language, and Lightning.

      Working with NPSP, I could understand the specific objects added to the core platform helping Nonprofit organizations with their needs.

      As an additional advantage of working directly for SFDC, I created a network with smart people that collaborated to improve the platform and are willing to help in case I need any guidance on this huge ecosystem.

      I am passionate about working in a Nonprofit environment, to recognize their value to the community, as I've had the chance of doing so for +20 years.

      Sincerely,
      
      Nobuchika Iwasaki<br><br><br>
